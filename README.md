ZeroValueTest

From wiki:
The frequency (or frequency within a block) test is used to test the randomness of a sequence of zeroes and ones (ZeroValueTest will covert a data set with exactly two distinct values to a sequence of zeroes and ones). The test is based on the proportion of zeroes and ones. Specifically, it tests the closeness of the proportion of ones to 0.5. The frequency within a block test is a refinement that tests the proportion of ones within M-value blocks.
